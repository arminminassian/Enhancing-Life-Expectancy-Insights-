**Overview**

This project aims to enhance insights into life expectancy by identifying and visualizing the factors influencing it. Leveraging Kaggle's public datasets, the project employs data cleaning techniques using Excel, including the replacement of missing values with regional averages. Utilizing Tableau, an interactive dashboard is crafted to illustrate the correlation of various socio-economic factors with life expectancy.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

The datasets sourced from Kaggle (World Health Organization) are subjected to data cleaning procedures using Excel. This involves handling missing values by replacing them with regional averages to ensure data integrity and consistency. The cleaned datasets serve as the foundation for the subsequent visualization process.

**Tableau Visualization Dashboard**

Tableau is utilized to create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that showcases the relationship between different socio-economic factors and life expectancy. The dashboard enables users to explore and analyze the data dynamically, facilitating deeper insights into the factors impacting life expectancy across various regions.

**Conclusion**

Through the combination of data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques, this project offers an insightful exploration of factors influencing life expectancy. The Tableau dashboard provides a user-friendly platform for exploring and understanding the complex relationships between socio-economic factors and life expectancy, with the potential to drive informed decision-making and interventions aimed at enhancing life expectancy outcomes globally.
